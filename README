A parser that parse go structures to prometheus exposition format. For now, we only support data models Counter, Gauge and Histogram. It uses the go structure tags to identify the type of prometheus metric for each
entry in the struct field. Note : This parsers only parses provide text output, Its responsibilty of the user to start the http service to publish
the text in /metrics.

constants defined 
	HISTOGRAM 
	GAUGE 
	COUNTER
	UNTYPE

var addToHandler prometheus_handler.HandlerStructure
addToHandler = append(addToHandler, struct {
	MType   int
	MName   string
	MLName  string
	MLValue string
	MValue  interface{}
}{MType: prometheus_handler.GAUGE, MName: "Field1", MValue: 2, MLValue: "labelvalue", MLName: "labelname"})

To use this library user has to pass the structure defined as per above guidelines and filled with values to following function
func GenericPromDataParser(structure HandlerStructure) string
The above function expects two arguments the structure to be parsed and labels to be added to all metrics
