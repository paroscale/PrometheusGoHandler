A parser that parses go structures to prometheus exposition format. For now, we only support data models Counter, Gauge and Histogram.  
Note : This parsers only parses provide text output, Its responsibilty of the user to start the http service to publish
the text in /metrics.

- Constants Defined 
	HISTOGRAM 
	GAUGE 
	COUNTER
	UNTYPE

- Append data to variable of type HandlerStructure
```
    addToHandler = append(addToHandler, struct {
           MType    int
	   MName    string
           LabelMap map[string]string
           MValue   interface{}
    }{MType: prometheus_handler.GAUGE, MName: "Field1", MValue: 2, LabelMap: labelMap})
```

To use this library user has to pass the structure defined as per above guidelines and filled with values to following function
func GenericPromDataParser(structure HandlerStructure) string
