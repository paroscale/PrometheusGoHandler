A parser that parse go structures to prometheus exposition format. It uses the go structure tags to identify the type of prometheus metric for each
entry in the struct field. Note : This parsers only parses provide text output, Its responsibilty of the user to start the http service to publish
the text in /metrics.


type <structName> struct {
 Field1 <dataType> `type:<metricType> metric:<metricName>`
}

For type histogram, The field has to have datatype to structure that has fields with tag "le" representing their less than or equal to bucket.

type Histogram struct {
 Num0 int `le:0`
 Num2 int `le:2`
 Num4 int `le:4`
}

type Export struct {
 Field1 Histogram `type:"Histogram" metric:"Field1"`
}


To use this library user has to pass the structure defined as per above guidelines and filled with values to following function
func GenericPromDataParser(structure interface{}, labels map[string]string) string
The above function expects two arguments the structure to be parsed and labels to be added to all metrics
